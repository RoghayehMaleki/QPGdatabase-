# Rank7SsinglegeneratorSITAs
This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of rank $7S$, valency k=3 to k=12, up to order $250$. 
The following notation has been used in the existence column in the Markdown Table:

AS: the program constructed a scheme for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.

TA-xHL: table algebra that failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable.

TA-xIM: table algebra that failed the integral multiplicity condition.

TA-xR: table algebra that is not realizable by the classification or because it fails some other feasibility condition.

-: table algebra that passes the feasibility conditions and the realizability is still open.
