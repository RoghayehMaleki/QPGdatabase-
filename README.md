This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of ranks $4S,5S,6S$ and $7S$ up to a different order and valency depending on each rank.
The following notation has been used in the Existence column in the Markdown Table:\\
AS:  the program constructed a scheme for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.\\
HL-TA: it failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable.\\ 
!: We did not check the feasibility program for these examples.
