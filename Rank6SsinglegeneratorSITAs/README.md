# Rank6SsinglegeneratorSITAs
This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of rank $6S$, up to order $250$. 
The following notation has been used in the status column in the Markdown Table:\\
AS:  the program constructed a scheme for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.\\
HL-TA: it failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable.\\ 
!: We did not check the feasibility program for these examples.
