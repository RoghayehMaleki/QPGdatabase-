# Rank4SsinglegeneratorSITAs
This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of order up to $40$. 
#AS means the program constructed a scheme for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.
#HL-TA means it failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable.
